## Introduction

Though the semester had been bizarre and stressful for me and my fellow undergrads, I continued to remain steadfast throughout my programming classes to further develop my skills as a computer engineer. The semester was filled with all kinds of challenges, mos

## Design Patterns

One of the most interesting topics I learned throughout my programming classes was design patterns, which focuses on applying reusable coding solutions for common software problems. To effictively apply a design pattern, a software developer must be able to define the situation the pattern is applicable and highlight the general solution provided by the pattern. In terms of object oriented programming, these solutions are often viewed as relationships between different classes and objects. For example, the Meteor web framework applies the MVC, Model View and Controller, design pattern to define data among the user and the system. In this semester, I had applied two design design patterns, Singleton and Object Pooling, in my game development project to increase the flexibility of my code and improve the overall performance of my game.
  
  Overall, I find JavaScript an easy language to learn. The logic and syntax of the language does not take a lot of effort to understand, almost like learning Python. However, in my opinion, the simplicity of the language can be a drawback for experienced programmers as it may be inefficient for more complex projects, such as software.

  Alongside efficiency, speed plays a major factor in measuring a programmerâ€™s skill. Even for an entry-level position, an employer should expect their employees to write code at a considerable pace. In this class, students are trained through athletic software engineering where they are assigned Workout of the Days (WODs) and must complete them as fast as possible. So far, the WODs given to me were simple and easy to code given a somewhat solid foundation of basic JavaScript and proficiency in solving algorithms. However, under a strict time limit I do tend to forget efficient methods and would usually write spaghetti code to make a working program, such as a large block of if-else statements. Nonetheless, I believe these workouts would help me build speed in developing foundations of a program so that people can move on to the optimization process sooner, like how a person revises their first drafts of an essay. I hope overtime in the next WODs, I can break out of that habit and make code both fast and efficiently.
