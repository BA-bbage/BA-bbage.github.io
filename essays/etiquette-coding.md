The appearance of a source code is crucial when sharing a program to others, especially for collaborators who may work on it later. Otherwise, it will be difficult for them to follow through the functionality of your program, which will consequently waste precious time for most, if not everyone. To prevent such a tragedy from occurring, many programmers familiarized themselves with basic coding etiquette when writing source code. 

Though a single absolute coding style does not exist, leaving it to oneâ€™s own interpretation, there are many factors of writing code that are common to nearly all existing styles. These include indentation, use of white space, and variable and function naming. During a week of coding sessions, I utilized a plug-in tool from the Java IDE IntelliJ IDEA called ESLint which tracks parts of a source that is not complying to its coding style rules, some of which are listed above. See the link below for the entire ruleset of ESLint.
