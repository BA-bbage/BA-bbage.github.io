summary: Developing a simple JRPG using the Unity Engine.

<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/jrpg.png">

Unity is a third-party game engine created by Unity Technologies and is considered well known across the gaming community alongside other popular game development software.
It allows game developers to create a variety of games ranging from 2D/3D games to simulations and can support development across multiple platforms, such as PC, console, and mobile. 

For this project, I will be utilizing Unity for the first time to create a very simple JRPG. Throughout the development process,
I will learn the basics of Unity in a 2D-game perspective and learn the mechanics of how a JRPG works, which includes a battle system, entity (player/enemy) data, item management, and story/events.

I hope by finishing this project, I will be able to gain enough experience to tackle a more ambitious RPG project in the future, a project I consider a "life goal".
