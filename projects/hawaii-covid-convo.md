## Contributions

### Implementing TestCafe Availability Tests
One of my major contributions for the final project was implementing availability tests using Node.js's automation tool, "TestCafe". With TestCafe, I was able to test our web application to see whether all pages in the application are displayed for both anonymous and login users. Furthermore, I was able to test whether all survey forms are operational with legal inputs. The code involving all the test processes are located under the tests folder in the app directory of our project.

### Improving Quality of Pages and Components
Another contribution I made for the final project was implementing additional details to the About page and the Footer. In the about page, I included profile cards for each group member of HI-Covid-Convo's development team. Each card contains a member's profile picture, biography, interests, and GitHub link. In the web application's footer, I added links for each page accessible to any user. One of the links directs a user to the Resources page which was not listed in the header bar.
